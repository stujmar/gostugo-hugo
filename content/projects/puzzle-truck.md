The Project: Puzzle Truck is a three-dimensional wooden puzzle that assembles into a working pull toy.
My Role: My friend James Kitia came to me with the idea of making a toy truck for his kids based on toys he made as a child in Tanzania. Using my lasercutter, we spent years on iterative design and prototyping to developed a finished prodcut worthy of store shelves. James and I also went through the Rogers Park Business Alliance's small business incubator program to help develop a scalable business plan. While the Puzzle Truck isn't currently in production, it remains on the back burner of my mind.
Takeaways: I learned a lot about design and iteration, as well as collaborating and making compromises. We also explored obtaining a patent on the Puzzle Truck, which taught me about design patents vs. utility patents and patenting vs. copywriting.
