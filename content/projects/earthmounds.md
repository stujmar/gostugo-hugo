The Project: Earthmounds was a long time coming. Since college I have been sketching hills with eyes, topped by little trees and houses. I imagined stories playing out, where the anthropomorphic land masses' problems mirrored the problems of the biomes they represented. Over the last decade, I've dedicated more energy toward the concept and it has evolved into an educational brand. Earthmounds aims to connect audiences with nature, helping them empathize with the environment itself through cute characterizations. I've designed and brought to market two decks of Earth Science Flashcards featuring the characters, and share new ones weekly through Earthmounds social media channels.
Takeaways: From design to manufacturing to wholesale sales, Earthmounds forced me to grow a lot as an artist and entrepreneur. I learned to source materials from over-seas, including navigating the intricacies of customs and frieght forwarding. I learned how to file copywrites and trademarks, how to register UPCs, and how to design PDQ/POP displays for retail shelves. I also did cold outreach to retail stores and distributors to carry the flashcards. This project continues to help me focus on honing my art skills to be more polished and commercially viable.
