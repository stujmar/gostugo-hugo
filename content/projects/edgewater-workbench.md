The Project: Edgewater Workbench was a community arts space that offered lasercutting and 3D printing services, as well as design classes for the community.
My Role: I was the founder and ran day-to-day operations. My responsibilities included: bidding jobs, sourcing materials, fabrication, and delivery to clients. I also designed curriculum for and taught community classes on digital fabrication.
Takeaways: My time at Edgewater Workbench was a trial by fire that taught me a lot about how to start and run a business. Aside from running my own service business, I helped other entrepreneurs as they prototyped products and brought their ideas to market. In addition to fabrication services, Edgewater Workbench supported the local creative community, hosting weekly drink and draws, monthly community repair clinics, and after school programming for high school students.
